/*
 * Hi there and welcome to this little coding kata. Here is what you should do:
 * 
 * 1. There is a file on the webserver, named lorem.html. It contains a lot of (html) text. 
 *    Write a javascript function, which fetches the contents of this file asynchronously 
 *    from the server and add the contents into the <div class="container"> div of the website.
 * 
 * 2. There are lots of o's in the imported text. As the letter o is very important for this exercise, 
 *    we should highlight it. Highlight all the o's with a renovero-blue background (see styles.css for 
 *    more information about that color) and white font color, a 30% bigger font size and add some 
 *    padding so that every o stands out.
 * 
 * 3. The letter 'r' is also very important. Highlight it in the same way, but use the renovero-yellow
 *    color this time.
